                    Hi, I'm Celia! I am a current freshman intending to major in MCB but also considering a minor in Art Practice. Some of my hobbies include reading, (which I don't have a lot of time for anymore), drawing and sketching (hence the art practice minor consideration), and being outdoors. I especially love spending time outdoors with my family. I'd say my favorite trip with them was a 5-day backpacking trip last summer! We went through parts of the John Muir Trail and the Pacific Coast Trail, so that's something I'd like to do in the future, maybe. I'm excited to be at Berkeley!
